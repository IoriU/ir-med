# Information Retrieval Using BSBI Indexing

This project presents a comprehensive exploration of information retrieval strategies within the context of the NF Corpus, a vital resource in the field of natural language processing. Undertaken as part of the Information Retrieval assignment at Fasilkom UI, this project investigates two distinct approaches to optimize information retrieval: a conventional methodology centered around LambdaRank and cutting-edge deep learning techniques employing Mono BERT and Dense Passage Retrieval.

The NF Corpus serves as the foundation of this study, providing a rich dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. The underlying indexing mechanism is based on the Block Sort-Based Indexing (BSBI) technique, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval of textual data.

The first approach adopts a conventional method, LambdaRank, a widely recognized algorithm for re-ranking search results. This approach aims to enhance the precision and relevance of search results by leveraging LambdaRank's capability to optimize ranking functions.

The second approach harnesses the potential of deep learning models to revolutionize information retrieval. By utilizing Mono BERT, an advanced variant of the BERT model, and Dense Passage Retrieval techniques, this approach seeks to exploit contextual embeddings and semantic representations for more accurate and contextually relevant search results.

Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, this project endeavors to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of the two approaches, shedding light on their respective strengths and weaknesses. The outcomes of this research are anticipated to contribute to the advancement of information retrieval methodologies and offer insights into the suitability of conventional and deep learning-based techniques for addressing challenges within the NF Corpus.

As the field of information retrieval continues to evolve, this project holds implications not only for the NF Corpus and its applications but also for the broader landscape of natural language processing, machine learning, and AI-driven knowledge discovery. By marrying traditional techniques with state-of-the-art deep learning models, this project underscores the interdisciplinary nature of modern information retrieval research.
